# Pathfork

---

Pathfork is an open-source writing tool that helps you keep track of your stories, characters, and settings. You can find it at [https://pathfork.herokuapp.com](https://pathfork.herokuapp.com).

Very much open to collaborators. There's a trello with a to-do list if you'd like to be added.
